Conway's Game of Life C# version
================================

The test project is named Gol (yeah, I will rename that somewhere in the future:)).
The implementation was moved later to a new project (GolImpl) and there is a CLI program to generate some visual output.

A trivial algorithm is used, so be patient on higher cell counts :)


Usage:
------

	GoL_CLI <path_to_dot_gol_file>

This generates an out.avi with MJPEG encoding to the current working directory.
